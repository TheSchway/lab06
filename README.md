## Typography

The original typeface seemed to decrease the readability of the website, so I looked for typefaces that worked well for body text and chose three: Cormorant Garamond for the headers, Montserrat for the paragraphs, and Playfair Display for the aside.

## Readability

I chose to increase the line height for the aside and the paragraph so as to make it easier to read. Additionally, I added a greater margin to the top and bottom of the sections to provide more space and generally increase readability. Finally, I added a bottom border to each section in order to better separate each student's information.
